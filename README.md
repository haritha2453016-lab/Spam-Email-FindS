Machine Learning Lab Experiments

This repository contains implementations of Machine Learning algorithms performed as part of the lab work using Google Colab and Python.

🧪 Experiment 1: Spam Email Classification using Find-S Algorithm

Implemented the Find-S algorithm to learn the most specific hypothesis for spam email classification.

Used a labeled spam email dataset with categorical features.

Generated the final hypothesis based on positive training examples.

🧪 Experiment 2: Candidate Elimination Algorithm

Implemented the Candidate Elimination algorithm to compute both specific and general hypotheses.

Used a categorical dataset to demonstrate version space learning.

Displayed the final Specific (S) and General (G) hypotheses.

🧪 Experiment 3: Spam Email Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm on the spam email dataset.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Evaluated the model using confusion matrix and accuracy score.

Analyzed the performance of the classifier.
