# Machine Learning Lab Experiments

This repository contains implementations of Machine Learning algorithms performed as part of the lab work using Google Colab and Python.

## Experiment 1: Spam Email Classification using Find-S Algorithm
- Implemented the Find-S algorithm to learn the most specific hypothesis for spam email classification.
- Used a labeled spam email dataset with categorical features.
- Generated the final hypothesis based on positive training examples.

## Experiment 2: Candidate Elimination Algorithm
- Implemented the Candidate Elimination algorithm to compute both specific and general hypotheses.
- Used a small categorical dataset to demonstrate version space learning.
- Displayed the final Specific (S) and General (G) hypotheses.

- Candidate_Elimination.ipynb

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- GitHub

## How to Run
1. Open any `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Observe the output for hypotheses.
